Error handling for unidentified SKU


The problem starts simply:

We want to develop a checkout system in a supermarket. It should be able to scan the SKU of the items and calculate the total price. To make it simple, assume the item SKU is a character, and the super market only has 4 items. The prices of them are listed below.

Item Sku | Price

A | 50

B | 30

C | 20

D | 15


**Ver 1.1**: Added Discount coupons functionality
